# Nucleotide Count

Given a DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.

DNA is represented by an alphabet of the following symbols: 'A', 'C',
'G', and 'T'.

Each symbol represents a nucleotide, which is a fancy name for the
particular molecules that happen to make up a large part of DNA.

Shortest intro to biochemistry EVAR:

- twigs are to birds nests as
- nucleotides are to DNA and RNA as
- amino acids are to proteins as
- sugar is to starch as
- oh crap lipids

I'm not going to talk about lipids because they're crazy complex.

So back to nucleotides.

DNA contains four types of them: adenine (`A`), cytosine (`C`), guanine
(`G`), and thymine (`T`).

RNA contains a slightly different set of nucleotides, but we don't care
about that for now.

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored.  After you get the first test to
pass, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the next test and get the tests
to pass again.  The test file is located in the `tests` directory.   You can
also remove the ignore flag from all the tests to get them to run all at once
if you wish.

Make sure to read the [Crates and Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/crates-and-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
